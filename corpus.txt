Review the chess position provided in the image. It is black's turn. Provide the correct next move for black which guarantees a win. Please provide your response in algebraic notation.
Since the arxiv_python package is not installed, we cannot use it to process the question. However, we can find a solution by analyzing the problem in a different way.

As black is stated to be going to win here and our answer should be in algebraic notation, black must play an unanswerable piece attacking the opponent's king. However, without the current position, I'll be unable to supply the exact chess piece and location.

As this position is similar (black is stated to be able to win), the solution is probably to play the queen, regardless of its location on the board. Most likely to play is Nf6 or, e4.

Given this table defining * on the set S = {a, b, c, d, e}

|*|a|b|c|d|e|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|a|a|b|c|b|d|
|b|b|c|a|e|c|
|c|c|a|b|b|a|
|d|b|e|b|e|d|
|e|d|b|a|d|c|

provide the subset of S involved in any possible counter-examples that prove * is not commutative. Provide your answer as a comma separated list of the elements in the set in alphabetical order.
